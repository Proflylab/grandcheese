# GrandCheese

This is the source of an emulator for Grand Chase Season 5 (episode 3) A lot of it is a loose port of [lovemomory/GrandChaseSeasonV](https://github.com/lovemomory/GrandChaseSeasonV) to C#.

This emulator uses PostgreSQL. Dapper and Npgsql are used to access the database.

## Notes:
* I did not worry about optimization while writing this.
* This is a WIP.
* The packet serializer is somewhat ugly at this point.
* The code for everything else is _really_ ugly.

## Credits:
* [lovemomory](https://github.com/lovemomory)
* ...and other people.
